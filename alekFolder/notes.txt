Some of the things that would be helpful for you to do are:

Folder one:
Binary is not getting the cracking as a full line. 
Look into the binary1 function and gaps_filled function to see if you can fix this.

Folder two:
Similar to folder one, the gaps in the line need to be fixed.
Another thing I have noticed with this image is a lot of extra dots in the images but they are not from noise, more the imperfections in the clay.
See if you can reduce the extra points and fill in the gaps.

Folder three:
Work to reduce the shadow in the image.
There should be same stuff online about this.

Notes that there are a bunch of images found in the images folder. Feel free to test those on any functions or code you have updated.
