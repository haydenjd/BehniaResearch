Research Notes:

Detection:
Can we get our program to see were the cracking is? How do we detect primary vs secondary cracking?

Thinning:
Taking our cracking and making it one pixel wide - this allows us to be able to get the length

Length:
Adding 1 to the length is there is a pixel horizonal or vertical from the selected one, radical two if diagonal

Code:
Putting all three of these parts together in one
